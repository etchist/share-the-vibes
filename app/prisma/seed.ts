"No problem," I thought, "I\'ll just check the usual suspects."</p><p>After hours of "vibe debugging" (aka randomly commenting out code and refreshing the page), I finally discovered that I had created an infinite loop in my useEffect hook. The cleanup function wasn\'t properly removing event listeners, and each re-render was adding new ones.</p><p>The fix was simple, but finding it? That took three energy drinks and a very concerned code review from my senior developer.</p>',
